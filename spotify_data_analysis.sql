/* 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly.
The dataset contains attributes such as:
Artist: The performer of the track.
Track: The name of the song.
Album: The album to which the track belongs.
Album_type: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.
